## [1.16.5-0.1.0] - 2021/10/19
### Initial port release notes
- Shelter structures have changed what they look like to accommodate the new village styles! You can find shelters with their Shelter Workers in any vanilla village. (However, cats and dogs currently do not spawn with the structure!)
- Shelter Workers will trade many things with you now, very different from 1.12.2, and not all of them will have cats to give you.
- A new block has been added as the Shelter Worker's work station, you can find them in the shelter structures. :) They're cute!
- Pet carriers may not work on any animals except for this mod's cats, this is not permanent.
- Cat bowl blocks have not yet been ported, they will return soon.
- Cat AI might be a little crazy lol.
- The cat count for each player is not yet implemented (including the command that goes along with this), meaning you cannot currently limit the number of cats tamed per player. (But this will be returning as well!)
